# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is for my HTML and CSS Projects at The Tech Academy.
I have created websites as well as desgined them using CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
These projects are amazing and I truly love developing them. 
It teaches me to continue developing as well as show off skills.
I know how to sharpen my skills when necessary (always) which will result into better sites.
A couple of my projects are listen below:

Projects:

This site is an example of a bakery in which it was styled using CSS. The site contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

Movie Theater Site

This is an example of a theater styled using Bootsrap 4. This site contains Bootstrap components that includes, but not limited to: a navbar, cards, form, dropdown, and jumbotron.
